    </div>
    <div class="text-box text-box-1">
      <h1>Monumental</h1>
      <p>
        From the perspective of a designer or a passerby, Boston City Hall's
        monumental appearance can be attributed to several key factors. For
        designers, the building is a textbook example of Brutalist architecture,
        showcasing the philosophy of form following function. The raw concrete
        construction, an intentional choice in Brutalism, exudes strength and
        permanence. The building's geometric design, with its sharp angles and
        block-like structures, creates a visually striking and formidable
        presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designers might also appreciate the way it challenges conventional
        aesthetics, representing a bold departure from traditional architecture.
        This deliberate emphasis on raw, unadorned materials and the building's
        stark form can be imposing, evoking a sense of awe or even discomfort,
        which are hallmark reactions to monumental architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        For passersby, the experience of the building is more about its scale
        and presence in the urban landscape. The sheer size of Boston City Hall,
        with its towering height and expansive footprint, dominates the visual
        field. This physical dominance, coupled with the building's strategic
        placement in Government Center, makes it a focal point in downtown
        Boston. The use of space around the building, including the plaza, also
        contributes to its monumental feel, as it sets the building apart from
        its surroundings, making it more prominent. Additionally, the building's
        role as a center of civic activity imbues it with a sense of importance
        and gravitas. For those walking by or interacting with it, Boston City
        Hall is not just a building; it's a symbol of governance and public
        life, making its monumental nature not just about its physical
        attributes but also about its significance in the daily life of the
        city.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box text-box-2" style="display: none">
      <h1>Heroic</h1>
      <p>
        When viewed through the lens of being 'heroic', Boston City Hall's
        architectural design and presence in the cityscape can evoke a different
        set of interpretations, particularly from the perspectives of designers
        and passersby. For designers, Boston City Hall as 'heroic' might be seen
        in its architectural defiance and innovation. Brutalist architecture, of
        which the City Hall is a prime example, was a radical departure from the
        ornate and decorative styles that preceded it. This building, with its
        raw concrete surfaces, bold, geometric forms, and fortress-like
        appearance, embodies a certain architectural heroism - a brave foray
        into uncharted design territory. This heroism is not in the traditional
        sense of adornment and beauty, but in its stark functionality and
        unapologetic departure from the norm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designers might view this as a heroic stand against conventional
        architectural aesthetics, representing a bold and unyielding vision of
        what a public building can be. From the perspective of a passerby, the
        'heroic' aspect of Boston City Hall might be more related to its scale,
        presence, and role in the city. The building's imposing size and
        distinct shape can be seen as a physical manifestation of the strength
        and resilience of the city's governance and public institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its prominence in the Government Center, a hub of civic activity, adds
        to this narrative, portraying the building as a steadfast guardian of
        the public interest. Furthermore, the way the building interacts with
        its surroundings - set apart from other structures, dominating the plaza
        - can give it a sense of being a sentinel or a protector, standing watch
        over the city. This physical and symbolic prominence, coupled with the
        building's role in the civic life of Boston, can contribute to a
        perception of it as 'heroic', representing the ideals and endurance of
        the city's public institutions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box text-box-3" style="display: none">
      <h1>Isolating</h1>
      <p>
        The perception of Boston City Hall's architecture as isolating can be
        attributed to several design elements and its interaction with the urban
        environment, as seen from both a designer's and a passerby's
        perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a designer's viewpoint, the isolating aspect of Boston City Hall
        often stems from its Brutalist architectural style. Brutalism, known for
        its raw, unadorned use of concrete and large, imposing structures, can
        create a sense of detachment or alienation. The building’s massive scale
        and the use of heavy, stark concrete forms may appear uninviting and
        fortress-like, distancing it from the human scale and the surrounding
        urban fabric. Designers might also point out the lack of traditional
        ornamentation or warm materials, which can contribute to a feeling of
        coldness and isolation. Furthermore, the building’s elevated plaza
        separates it physically from street level, creating a literal and
        figurative barrier between the structure and the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a passerby, the experience of Boston City Hall might also evoke
        feelings of isolation. The building's sheer size and imposing presence
        can be overwhelming, making individuals feel small in comparison. The
        expansive, open plaza surrounding the building, often sparsely
        populated, can enhance a sense of emptiness and detachment from the
        bustling city life. The lack of inviting entrances or clear, welcoming
        pathways to the building can make it seem inaccessible or disconnected
        from the community. The starkness of the concrete and the geometric,
        rigid form of the building contrast with the more traditional, warm, and
        inviting architecture commonly found in public buildings, further
        contributing to a sense of isolation. This disconnect between the
        building and its urban context can make Boston City Hall appear as an
        isolated entity, rather than an integrated part of the city's social and
        civic fabric.

    <div class="text-box text-box-4" style="display: none">
      <h1>Scary</h1>
      <p>
        <!-- Placeholder text for the fourth box -->
        Imagine a scene where Boston City Hall's Brutalist architecture evokes a
        sense of fear or unease. From the perspective of a visitor or a
        passerby, the building's immense scale and raw concrete structure cast
        imposing shadows in the fading light of dusk. The sharp angles and
        block-like forms of the building create an almost labyrinthine effect,
        making the structure seem like a maze from which there is no easy
        escape. The lack of ornamental features and the cold, unadorned surfaces
        of the concrete contribute to a feeling of starkness and severity. The
        building towers over the observer, its monumental size making one feel
        small and vulnerable. This overwhelming presence, coupled with the eerie
        quietness of the surrounding plaza at night, creates a sense of
        foreboding and intimidation, making the building appear not just
        monumental, but downright scary.

        <span class="about-title">About</span> <p> Experience Boston City Hall from the unique viewpoints of both architects and the general public. 
            This website aims to understand the controversy surrounding this iconic structure â€“ 
            celebrated as monumental by architects and designers while simultaneously labeled as an eyesore by the public. 
            Rather than seeking to merge these differing opinions,
            we provide a platform to showcase both perspectives with the hope that one can understand the other, as neither one holds the absolute truth.
            <p>Architects worldwide have long revered Boston City Hall as an important masterpiece. 
            Going so far as calling it "architectural treasure", "heroic" and "democratic". Meanwhile, for many in the general public, Boston City Hall has been a source of controversy, calling the building "indecipherable", "abomination", and of course "ugly".</p>
            This website aims to explore, view and re-view, what the other sees 
             by studying the building's perceived starkness and its unconventional looks from all angles possible.
            The intention is not to reconcile these contrasting viewpoints but to present the richness of the discourse surrounding Boston City Hall. 
            The Brutalist building transcends being just a structure; 
            it embodies the beauty of differing opinions and the power of architecture to inspire thought-provoking discussions while also simply being that brute entity that people simply find out of place.

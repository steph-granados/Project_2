    <p> Experience Boston City Hall from the (ad)vantage points of both architects and the general public.
      This website aims to understand the controversy surrounding this iconic structure.
      Rather than seeking to merge these differing opinions,
      this platform showcases both perspectives with the hope that one can understand the other, with the awareness that neither holds the absolute truth.
      <p>Architects worldwide have long held Boston City Hall in high esteem, lauding it as an architectural treasure, a heroic creation, and a symbol of democracy.
        In contrast, the general public has often criticized the building as indecipherable, an abomination, and, plainly, ugly.</p>
      The Vantage Points, will help view and re-view, what the other sees
       by studying the building's perceived starkness and its unconventional looks from all angles possible.
      The intention is not to reconcile these contrasting viewpoints, but to present the richness of the discourse surrounding Boston City Hall.
      The Brutalist building transcends being just a structure;
      it embodies the beauty of differing opinions and the power of architecture to inspire thought-provoking discussions while also simply being that brute entity that people simply find out of place.
